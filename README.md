# Camie - A Crowd Counting System
Camie is a crowd counting system that uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to count the number of people in an image captured by a camera. It consists of three components: a camera software, an API containing a deep learning model, and a website where the user can enter a threshold.

# How it works
Camera software: The camera software captures images of crowds and sends them to the API for processing.

API: The API contains a deep learning model that analyzes the images and counts the number of people in them. The model is trained on a large dataset of crowd images to ensure accuracy.

Website: The website allows the user to enter a threshold, which is the maximum number of people allowed in the crowd. If the count generated by the API is more than the threshold, an alert is thrown to notify the user.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/camie.git
# Install the necessary packages:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Start the camera software:
Copy code
python camera.py
# Start the API:
Copy code
python api.py
# Open the website:
javascript
# Copy code
http://localhost:5000/
# Usage
Enter the threshold in the input field on the website.

The camera software will capture an image of the crowd and send it to the API for processing.

The API will count the number of people in the image and compare it with the threshold.

If the count is more than the threshold, an alert will be thrown on the website.
